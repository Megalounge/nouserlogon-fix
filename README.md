download python from their website
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.3/python-3.11.3-amd64.exe


open cmd.exe as admin and install these libraries using the command below

`pip install pywin32`
`pip install keyboard`
`pip install pyautogui`
`pip install opencv-python`
`pip install Pillow`

locate your pythonw.exe in your python install path, open properties and set it to always run as administrator

next open the python script I provided with IDLE, and Run the module

Profit!

You can run the command `disconnect "No user logon."` in your csgo console to test if this works for you.
